## Tweaker (2.0)

Tweaker is a continuation of [prplz](https://github.com/prplz) and [h1nk](https://github.com/h1nk)'s mods, [steev](https://github.com/prplz/steev) and [tweaker](https://github.com/h1nk/tweaker).

Obviously the name Tweaker is branched off of h1nk's mod, but i felt it fits so i used it.

The aim of this mod is to fix a series of bugs introduced or existing in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) 1.8, or improvements to the game.

### Bug Fixes

- Nausea Effect displays a Portal animation when clearing
- Respawn button is greyed out if you toggle fullscreen in the menu
- Players arm position isn't properly set when toggling perspective on a mountable Entity
- Moving your mouse has a delay to it, causing inaccurate clicks
- Game crashes due to a null scoreboard registry
- Screenshots lag the game for a bit
- Game takes a bit to switch worlds

### QOL Changes

- Borderless Fullscreen (Windowed Fullscreen)
- Games like Skywars on Hypixel no longer bring you out of chat when it starts
- Fullbright
- Sky is set to 0 regardless of world type, removing the black sky line below y63
- Centered inventory when potion effect is applied
